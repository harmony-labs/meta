# Context for meta-rs

## Background

`meta-rs` is a Rust rewrite of the original `meta` tool, which was written in JavaScript. The original tool was created to manage multi-project systems and libraries, allowing developers to execute commands across multiple repositories.

## Motivation for Rewrite

1. **Performance**: Rust's performance characteristics make it an excellent choice for a CLI tool that needs to be fast and efficient.

2. **Cross-platform compatibility**: By compiling to a single executable, we can simplify the installation process and avoid dependency issues.

3. **Memory safety**: Rust's strong type system and ownership model help prevent common programming errors and improve overall reliability.

4. **Learning opportunity**: This rewrite serves as an excellent opportunity to explore how to implement similar functionality in a systems programming language like Rust.

## Key Differences from Original

- Single executable instead of a Node.js-based CLI tool
- No plugin system (initially) - core functionality will be built-in
- Simplified configuration using a `.meta` file in JSON format
- Focus on core functionality first, with potential for expansion later

## Target Audience

- Developers managing multi-repo projects
- Teams looking for an efficient way to execute commands across multiple repositories
- Users of the original `meta` tool who want improved performance and simplified installation

## Future Considerations

- Potential implementation of a plugin system
- Expansion of built-in commands and features
- Integration with CI/CD systems

This context should guide the development process and help maintain focus on the core goals of the `meta-rs` project.
