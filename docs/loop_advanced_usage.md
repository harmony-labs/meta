## Parallel Execution Strategies

The loop system can execute commands in parallel across many directories. You can control concurrency and error handling via CLI flags or `.looprc`:

```json
{
  "directories": ["pkg1", "pkg2"],
  "concurrency": 4,
  "fail_fast": true
}
```

## Advanced Configuration

- **Directory Globs**: Use wildcards in `.looprc` to target groups of directories.
- **Ignore Patterns**: Exclude directories with the `ignore` field.
- **Verbose Output**: Enable detailed logs with `--verbose` or `"verbose": true` in config.

## Scripting with loop_cli

`loop_cli` is script-friendly and can be used in shell scripts or CI jobs:

```sh
loop --include-only pkg1,pkg2 cargo test
```

Chain commands for complex workflows:

```sh
loop npm install && loop npm test
```

## Integration with CI/CD

Integrate loop into CI pipelines for parallelized builds, tests, or deployments. Example (GitHub Actions):

```yaml
- name: Run tests in all packages
  run: loop cargo test
```

## Debugging & Troubleshooting

- Use `loop --verbose` for detailed output.
- Check `.looprc` for correct directory and ignore patterns.
- For library integration, enable Rust backtraces with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1`.
