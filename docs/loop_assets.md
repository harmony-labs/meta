- Use descriptive filenames, e.g., `loop-cli-screenshot.png`.
- Reference screenshots in documentation using relative paths.

## Architecture Diagrams

- Diagrams illustrating the loop system's architecture should be placed here.
- Use SVG or PNG format for clarity.
- Example: `loop-architecture-overview.svg`

## Contributing Visual Assets

- Add new assets to this directory.
- Update documentation to reference new assets.
- Ensure images are optimized for web (compressed, reasonable resolution).
- Include a short description of each asset in this README.
