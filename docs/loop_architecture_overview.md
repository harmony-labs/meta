## System Overview

The loop system is a modular, parallel command execution engine for the Meta platform, designed to automate tasks across multiple directories.

## Core Components

- **loop_cli**: CLI entry point, parses arguments, dispatches commands.
- **loop_lib**: Core Rust library for directory expansion, command execution, config parsing, and error handling.
- **.looprc**: JSON configuration file specifying directories, ignore patterns, and options.

## Configuration

The `.looprc` file controls which directories are targeted and how commands are executed:

```json
{
  "directories": ["pkg1", "pkg2"],
  "ignore": ["legacy_pkg"],
  "concurrency": 4
}
```

## Command Execution Flow

1. User invokes a `loop` command via CLI.
2. CLI loads `.looprc` and parses arguments.
3. loop_lib expands directories and applies filters.
4. Commands are executed in parallel.
5. Results are aggregated and reported.

## Extensibility Points

- Add new CLI options in `loop_cli/src/`.
- Extend core logic in `loop_lib/src/`.
- Support for custom directory filters and output formats.

## Key Modules

- `config`: Loads and validates `.looprc`.
- `executor`: Handles parallel command execution.
- `filter`: Applies inclusion/exclusion logic.
- `report`: Aggregates and formats results.
