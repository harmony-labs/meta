# Implementation Plan for meta and loop

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Functionality

1. Set up project structure using Cargo workspaces
   - Create a root directory for the workspace
   - Create separate directories for `meta` and `loop` crates
   - Set up a shared library crate for common functionality
   - Configure Cargo.toml files for workspace and individual crates

2. Implement core `loop` functionality
   - Set up error handling and logging
   - Implement `.looprc` file parsing
   - Develop command execution logic
   - Build CLI interface using clap or structopt
   - Implement directory filtering options (--include, --exclude, etc.)
   - Ensure color output from child commands is retained

3. Develop `meta` functionality
   - Implement `.meta` file parsing
   - Create logic to pass directory list to `loop`
   - Implement `meta`-specific commands (e.g., `meta --list`)

4. Integrate `loop` library into `meta`
   - Use `loop` as a dependency in `meta`
   - Implement `meta` commands using `loop` functionality

## Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality

5. Implement common Git commands in `loop`
   - `loop git status`
   - `loop git pull`
   - `loop git push`

6. Add parallel execution option to `loop`
   - Implement multi-threading for running commands in parallel
   - Add a `--parallel` flag to enable parallel execution
   - Show spinner and summary of each command being run
   - Show combined output when done, retaining color from child processes

7. Improve error handling and reporting in both `loop` and `meta`
   - Implement detailed error messages
   - Add color-coded output for better readability

8. Extend `meta` functionality
   - Implement `meta`-specific features that leverage `loop`
   - Ensure `meta` correctly handles `loop` options like directory filtering

## Phase 3: Testing and Documentation

9. Write comprehensive tests
   - Unit tests for core functions in both `loop` and `meta`
   - Integration tests for CLI functionality
   - Tests for the interaction between `meta` and `loop`

10. Create documentation
    - Write comprehensive READMEs for both `loop` and `meta`
    - Document the API for using `loop` as a library
    - Create man pages for both tools

## Phase 4: Polish and Distribution

11. Set up CI/CD pipeline
    - Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing and building
    - Set up automated releases for multiple platforms

12. Prepare for distribution
    - Set up binary releases on GitHub for both `loop` and `meta`
    - Investigate distribution through package managers (e.g., Homebrew, Chocolatey)

## Phase 5: Future Enhancements

13. Optimize performance
    - Profile both applications to identify bottlenecks
    - Implement performance improvements

14. Enhance user experience
    - Add interactive mode for certain commands
    - Implement command suggestions for mistyped commands

15. Consider additional features
    - Analyze user feedback and usage patterns
    - Implement new features that benefit both `loop` and `meta` users

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing both the `loop` and `meta` tools as separate but interconnected projects. The plan focuses on leveraging `loop` as a library within `meta`, while also maintaining them as independent executables. The plan can be adjusted as development progresses and new requirements or challenges arise.
