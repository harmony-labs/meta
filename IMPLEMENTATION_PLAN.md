# Implementation Plan for meta

## Phase 1: Core Functionality

1. Set up project structure and dependencies
   - Create a new Rust project using Cargo
   - Set up error handling and logging

2. Implement `.meta` file parsing
   - Create a struct to represent the `.meta` file contents
   - Implement JSON parsing for the `.meta` file

3. Develop command execution logic
   - Create a function to execute shell commands
   - Implement logic to run commands in specified directories

4. Build basic CLI interface
   - Use a CLI argument parsing library (e.g., clap)
   - Implement basic command-line interface
   - Ensure color output from child command is retained in parent process (potentially by using `std::process::Command`)

5. Implement core commands
   - `meta [command]`: Execute a command in all specified directories
   - `meta --list`: List all projects defined in the `.meta` file

## Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality

6. Implement common Git commands
   - `meta git status`
   - `meta git pull`
   - `meta git push`

7. Add parallel execution option
   - Implement multi-threading for running commands in parallel
   - Add a `--parallel` flag to enable parallel execution
   - Show spinner and summary of each command being run
   - Show combined output when done, retaining color from child processes

8. Improve error handling and reporting
   - Implement detailed error messages
   - Add color-coded output for better readability

## Phase 3: Polish and Distribution

9. Write comprehensive tests
   - Unit tests for core functions
   - Integration tests for CLI functionality

10. Set up CI/CD pipeline
    - Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing and building
    - Set up automated releases for multiple platforms

11. Create documentation
    - Write a comprehensive README
    - Create man pages for the tool

12. Prepare for distribution
    - Set up binary releases on GitHub
    - Investigate distribution through package managers (e.g., Homebrew, Chocolatey)

## Phase 4: Future Enhancements (Post-Initial Release)

13. Consider implementing a plugin system
    - Research best practices for plugin systems in Rust
    - Design and implement a basic plugin architecture

14. Add more built-in commands
    - Analyze most-used commands from the original `meta` tool
    - Implement additional built-in commands based on user feedback

15. Optimize performance
    - Profile the application to identify bottlenecks
    - Implement performance improvements

16. Enhance user experience
    - Add interactive mode for certain commands
    - Implement command suggestions for mistyped commands

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing the `meta` tool, focusing on core functionality first and then expanding to more advanced features. The plan can be adjusted as development progresses and new requirements or challenges arise.
